- Hash Table:
	a data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup

	- Hash Function:
		a function that converts a given big input key to a small practical integer value

		Example:
			- Input: "agaactaaggcca"
			- Output: 6 <- count "a"
			- Output: 54 <- count "a" * count "c" * count "g" * count "t"

			- Input: "aaaaaacccgggt"
			- Output: 6 <- count "a"
			- Output: 54 <- count "a" * count "c" * count "g" * count "t"

			so its the same hash size for both inputs as well as inputs like
			"aaaaaattttttgc" and "taggggggcccccc"
